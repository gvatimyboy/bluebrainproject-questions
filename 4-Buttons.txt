Specifications
--------------

Create a file named "Buttons.html". It should be a valid HTML5 document that will display a page containing 10 buttons.

Each button has its own number, from 1 to 10. When a user activates a button, a message appears with the button value.

If you have time, make the page look good by adding relevant CSS styling.
