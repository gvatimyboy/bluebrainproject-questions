Incremental timeout
===================

Specifications
--------------

Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. Each number x should be printed x seconds after the previous number.
The program should end right after printing the last number (no timeout).

The execution of the program would go like this:

    // wait 1 second
    1
    // wait for 2 seconds
    2
    // wait for 3 seconds
    3
    ...
    // wait for 100 seconds
    100
    (program exits without waiting)
 

Questions
---------

 1. Edit a file named timeout.js implementing a program that satisfies the specification. You're allowed to use any version of Javascript or Typescript.

 2. Provide a brief description of other ways of solving this problem you can see, with their advantages and drawbacks. Implementation is optional.

 3. Describe how would you go about unit testing this program that waits a lot. Do not provide an implementation.

Question 2: I initially tought of solving this problem with RxJS and Observables using the interval() operator. However, I don't think this would have been allowed since RxJS is a third-party library (even though very popular). When it comes to asynchronous code, I think the only options available are Observables and Promises.


Question 3: I'm no expert in unit testing but I would add a parameter to the function allowing us to feed it the upper limit number. Therefore we could feed the function a small number (e.g. 3) for our test and only wait a few seconds to ensure that it's working properly.
