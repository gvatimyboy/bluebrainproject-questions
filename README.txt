Frontend Developper Exercises
============================

Here are 5 exercises that will give you a flavour of the kind of work we do on a day to day basis in our team. 

Exercises
---------

Each of these exercises are independent and can be done in any order. Some exercises may be harder than others so it is up to you to choose which one your want to tackle first.

The exercises are as follow:
  - 1-Dense_Numbers.txt (writing an algorithm)
  - 2-Incremental_Timeout.txt (solving a code puzzle)
  - 3-Code_Review.txt (fixing bugs and reviewing code quality)
  - 4-Buttons.txt (building a web page)
  - 5-Experience_Quiz.txt (assessing your experience with various technologies)

Time constraints
----------------

We expect you to be able to complete these 5 exercises in up to 3 hours. That is, from the moment of receiving the email containing the test. The time at which we receive your email with your answers will be used to determine the time it took to complete the test. Say if we have agreed that you want to receive the test today at 8pm, we will dispatch the email at 8pm, and if you send us back your answers at 10:30pm, then we will assess that you have completed the test in 2h30m.

Take your time and don't try to finish the test earlier. The quality of your solutions is more important than the time. 

A note about questions
----------------------

Despite our best efforts to make this test straight forward to understand, we do realise that some parts of it might not be entirely clear to you. Should this happen, we encourage you to describe the specific problem(s) and explain what choice you have made to enable yourself to keep going with the test.
